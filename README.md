## Introduction

LibWres is a C++ library for reading and parsing Windows Portable Executable (PE) files. Based on wrestool from [icoutils](https://www.nongnu.org/icoutils/).

This library is primarily written for [libqmsstyles](https://github.com/The-Evil-Ass-Fountain-Openers/libqmsstyles), but it can be used as a generic library for parsing and extracing resources from files that follow the PE format (`.exe`, `.dll`, `.mui`, `.msstyles`, etc. files).

## TODO:

- Write test examples
